# CSCI_5352_Networks_Project
In this project for our networks course, we attempt to reproduce the result of [Nazemi and Jamali (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2018.00105/full) wherein they explore the effects of network topology on a Wilson-Cowan system for rings of neuronal populations.
